= Basic Theory of Money

== The origin of money

=== A few representative theories on the origin of money

+ Aristotle's theory of the monetary state-setting
+ Mercantilist theory of monetary metals and the quantity theory of  money
  - Arise spontaneously in the process of exchange
+ Baben's theory of monetary nominalism
  - Arises spontaneously in the process of exchange
+ The Classical school's monetary commodity theory
  - Arise spontaneously in the process of exchange (Focuses on the function of money as a medium of exchange, e.g., "smoke" in prisons)

=== Modern economics on the origin of money

+ Money is the natural choice of human society for the mode of  transaction.
+ The collapse of the gold standard system at the beginning of the  20th century, the influence of the monetary metal theory is  waning. The current dominant monetary doctrine is the monetary  nominalism, in which economists believe that money is universally accepted by the social public as a means of payment for goods  and services.

== Definition of money

=== Definition of money by economists

+ Money is anything that is widely accepted in the purchase of goods and services or in the settlement of debts.
+ According to Milton Friedman, money is a temporary habitat for purchasing  power.
+ According to Frederick Mishkin: Anything that is generally accepted in the payment of goods and services or the settlement of debts.

=== The difference between money and related concepts

1. money & currency - Do you have money?
  - Currency is a part of money, and a very small one at that. Checks have the same function as currency.
2. money & wealth - He has a lot of money.
  - Money is an expression of wealth, but not the only form of wealth.
3. money & income - He can earn a large amount of money.
  - Income is the flow of earnings in a certain unit of time, while money is a definite amount at a certain point in time, i.e. the concept in the sense of stock.

== Evolution of the form of money

- The form of money's existence has *evolved in accordance with the development of production and exchange*.
- The evolution of the form of money, first of all, is focused on the change of monetary materials, and the evolution of the form of money has gone through the stages of *"physical money - metal money - substitute money - credit money"*.
- From the historical trend of the development of money, the form of money evolves from low to high level with the increase of economic development, and gradually *tends to digitalization and virtualization*.

=== Physical money

- Disadvantages: bulky size, varying quality, difficult to divide, inconvenient to carry, and easy to deteriorate.
- As a result, physical money could not serve as an ideal medium of exchange and was not suitable as a standard of value and a means of storing value, and was replaced by metal money as the economy developed and changed over time.

=== Metal money:

Money made of metal (e.g., copper, gold, silver, etc.)

Because the ideal material as a currency should have the following characteristics.
+ It can be easily standardized.
+ It must be divisible.
+ It is easy to carry.
+ It is not easy to deteriorate.

=== Substitute currency

- Paper money issued by a government or bank that represents physical money.
- Used as an alternative to physical money and is generally in the form of paper vouchers, hence it is also called paper money.
- An undervalued currency, but because they are fully guaranteed by precious metals, they are readily convertible.
- Widely circulated in the market because they are guaranteed and readily convertible.

=== Credit money

- It is the non-redeemable currency put into circulation through normal bank credit channels and deposit money created by bank credit activities.
- As a general medium of exchange requires two conditions: confidence in this currency and legislative guarantees for its issuance.
- Can be subdivided into the following forms:
  + Auxiliary money.
  + Cash or paper money.
  + Deposit currency.

=== Electronic money

- Bank cards, stored value cards, etc.

=== Digital currencies

- Although digital currencies belong to the category of electronic money, they have increasingly become a hot issue of concern for stakeholders, including central banks, since 2008, with the emergence of decentralized Bitcoin, both in terms of theoretical research and payment practices.
- Can be divided into
  + private digital currencies, which are issued by private institutions - even without any issuer (e.g. Bitcoin),
  + legal digital currencies, which are issued by central banks.

== Functions of money

In any economic society, money, whether it is shell, gold or silver, or even paper money, has four functions: the *measure of value*, the *medium of exchange*, the *store of value*, and the *means of payment*. The measure of value and medium of exchange is the *basic function of money*, and the store of value and the means of payment functions are an extension of the basic functions.

=== The measure of value

When money is used to measure and calculate the value of goods and services, it performs the function of a measure of value.

/ Characteristics: Only conceptual or imaginary money is needed, not real money, but it must be full-value money.
- The measure of value function of money reduces the number of prices that need to be taken into account, thus reducing transaction costs in the economy.
- As a unified measure of value, money enables comparison of all types of income and expenses, which in turn developed into accounting for the modern society and established a system of cost-profit accounting.

=== The medium of exchange

When money acts as a medium of exchange for goods and services, it performs the function of a medium of exchange.

/ Characteristics: A realistic currency that can be under-valued.
- People pay attention to the purchasing power of money, and symbolic notes can be used as money. Paper money and credit money thus came into being.
- The use of money as a medium of exchange saves a great deal of time spent on trading goods and services, thus greatly increasing economic efficiency and thereby encouraging specialization and the division of labor.
- In contrast, in a barter economy, transactions are concluded on the condition that there is a dual coupling of demand, both in time and in demand.

=== The store of value

The third function of money is to serve as a means of storing wealth, or a form of holding wealth.

*This function is derived from the medium of exchange.*
- Currency may not be the most attractive store of value, but people are happy to hold it because it is one of the most liquid assets.
  - *Liquidity* is the ease and speed with which an asset can be converted into a medium of exchange without suffering losses.
- As the means of storing value, the risk of money is inflation (loss of purchasing power).
- The store of value function of money gives it the role of spontaneously regulating the money supply in circulation.

=== The means of payment

Money functions as a means of payment when paying debts or making unilateral payments.

*This function is derived from the medium of exchange.*

/ Functions:
- *Positive*: payment offsets, saving circulation costs; accelerating capital turnover through non-cash settlement; promoting capital concentration and efficient use.
- *Negative*: further disconnecting the buying and selling chain, increasing the possibility of supply and demand imbalance; forming a debt chain of economic agents, the possibility of a debt crisis.

When money is used as an independent form of value for unilateral transfers of value, such as settling debts, paying taxes, paying rent, water bills, and wages, it serves as a deferred payment, i.e. performs the function of a means of payment of money.

== Classification of money levels

=== The basis and practical significance of the classification of money levels

The purpose of the classification of money levels is to facilitate central bank monitoring and monetary policy operations.

*Theoretical and empirical definition of the scope of money.*

/ Theoretical definition:
- Using economic theory, money is a medium of exchange (narrowly defined money).
- Denoted by M1.
- $M_1$ = Currency + Checking Account Deposit + Traveler's cheques.
- $M_1=C+D=M_0+D$

/ Empirical definition:
- When determining the scope of money should be based on the economic variables to be specified and predicted economic variables to be specified and predicted.
- Broad Money Indicators.
- Weighted money aggregates.

/ Basis: The degree of liquidity.
-  high degree of liquidity, that is, the turnover in circulation is more convenient, and accordingly the ability to form purchasing power is stronger; low liquidity, that is, the turnover is not convenient, and accordingly the ability to form purchasing power is weaker.

/ Significance: Different money supply of different monetary nature has a different impact on the social economy.
- The purpose of classifying the money levels is to examine the socio-economic impact of various currencies with different liquidity. and to select a group of currencies closely related to economic development as the focus of central bank control, which also facilitates It also facilitates the monitoring of macroeconomic operations and monetary policy operations by the central bank.

=== Major countries’ classification of money levels

*Narrowly defined money*, denoted by M1:
- M1 = Currency + Checking account deposits + Traveler's cheques
- From the perspective of government, M1 in the narrow sense is the monetary indicator that is generally accepted and strictly controlled in countries around the world today. Usually, people call checking account deposits and traveler's cheques collectively as demand deposits, and use D to denote them; C (Currency) or M0 is used to denote the total amount of currency circulating outside the banking system.
- Therefore, we have $M_1 = C + D = M_0 + D$.

/ IMF’s classification of money levels:
According to the liquidity of financial assets, the International Monetary Fund divides money into M0, M1, and M2 three levels.
- M0 = cash currency circulating outside the banking system.
- M1 = M0 + demand deposits.
- M2 = M1 + savings deposits + time deposits + government bonds (including treasury securities)
#if verbose [
/ The Federal Reserve’s classification of money levels:
According to the liquidity of financial assets, the International Monetary Fund divides money into M0, M1, and M2 three levels.
- M1 = cash in circulation + traveler's cheques + demand deposits + other
- checking deposits (e.g. NOW accounts, ATS accounts, etc.).
- M2 = M1 + savings deposits + small-denomination (under \$100,000) time deposits + retail money market mutual funds + overnight repurchase agreements + overnight Eurodollars + adjustment items
- M3 = M2 + large-denomination time deposits + institutional holdings of money market mutual funds + term repurchase agreements + term Eurodollars + adjustment items
- L = M3 + Other short-term liquid assets

/ Bank of Japan’s classification of money levels:
- M1 = cash + demand deposits
- M2 + CD = M1 + quasi-currency + negotiable certificates of deposit
- M3 + CD = M2 + CD + deposits in postal, agricultural, fishery, credit, and labor cooperatives, as well as deposits in monetary trusts and lender trusts
- In addition, there is broad liquidity equal to "M3 + CD" plus repurchase agreement bonds, financial bonds, national bonds, investment trusts, and foreign bonds

/ European Central Bank’s classification of money levels:
- M1 = cash in circulation + overnight deposits
- M2 = M1 + time deposits with a maturity of less than 2 years+ call deposits with a notice period of 3 months or less
- M3 = M2 + repurchase agreements + money market funds (MMFs) + money market bills + bonds with a maturity of up to two years
- M3 is the money indicator that the European Central Bank focuses on monitoring. Repurchase agreements, money market fund shares, etc. that makeup M3 highly liquid and a good substitute for deposits.
]
/ The People's Bank of China’s classification of money levels:
- M0 = cash in circulation
- M1 = M0 + demand deposits of enterprises + demand deposits of institutions and organizations + rural demand deposits + deposits of credit type held by individuals
- M2 = M1 + savings deposits of urban and rural residents + time deposits of corporate units with time nature + foreign currency deposits + trust-type deposits + deposits of clients of securities companies + deposits of housing provident fund centers + money market funds held by non-depository institutions sector
- M3 = M2 + financial bonds + commercial paper + large negotiable time certificates of deposit
- where M1 is narrow money, M2 is broad money, and M2 minus M1 is quasi money

== Monetary System

=== Definition of the monetary system

*The monetary system* is a system in which the state regulates the relevant elements of money and the organization and management of its circulation in the form of laws.
- The monetary system first arose with the unification of national currency minting.
- In the pre-capitalist period, the minting and circulation of money were not unified, and the circulation of money was quite mixed The currency circulation was quite chaotic.
- After the bourgeoisie gained state power, a unified and stable monetary system was gradually established. The system of money.

=== Components of the Monetary System

*The materials of money* are the coinage materials used by a country to determine what metal will serve as the local currency.
- Choice of the material of money is the basis for establishing a monetary system.
- The choice of the material of money is determined solely by the objective economic conditions of the time.
- The progression of the commodity economy from underdeveloped to developed determines the material of money from base metals to precious metals to precious metals and then to paper money.

*The unit of money* is the unit of measurement of money as specified in the monetary system.
- Under the gold standard: to determine the weight of the monetary metal contained in each currency unit.
- Under the credit money standard: money does not specify the gold content, the unit of money is separated from the weight of gold and silver.
- Determine the name of the unit of money. In international custom, the name of a country's unit of money is often just the name of the country's currency plus the name of the unit of money.

*Minting, issuance, and circulation procedures of currency.*
- *Standard currency*: The legal base currency of a country and is the last means of payment.
- *Fractional currency*: Small amounts of currency below the local currency for sporadic daily transactions.

*Preparation of currency issuance*
- *The issuance of currency* is subject to the use of some metal or some form of the asset as a reserve for the issuance of currency so that the issuance of currency is linked to and constrained by these reserves, mainly for the purpose of restraining the scale of currency issuance to maintain the credit of the currency.
  + Preparation of cash: Gold, silver, foreign exchange, etc.
  + Preparation of guarantee: Short-term bills, treasury bills, etc.

=== Evolution of the monetary system

*The monetary system* arose from the unified minting of coins by the state, and the perfect standardized monetary system emerged with the emergence of the capitalist system. From the perspective of the historical development process, the evolution of the monetary system in the world has generally experienced several types of silver standard systems, gold and silver compound standard systems, gold standard systems, and credit money systems.

==== Metal money system

+ *Silver standard.*
  - The silver standard is a monetary system in which a certain amount of silver is used to express and calculate the value of a unit of money.
  - *Weaknesses*: With the economic development and the increase in the number of transactions, silver of large volume and small value cannot meet the needs of transactions.
+ *Gold and silver bimetallic standard.*
  - The gold and silver bimetallic standard is to let gold and silver two specific minted coins at the same time as the standard currency and provide for their coinage value comparison of a monetary system.
  - Parallel standard; Double standard; Limping standard.
  - *The law of bad money drives out good money* is also known as *"Gresham's Law"*.
    - *Advantages*: sufficient coin material, convenient trading
    - *Disadvantages*: value scale duality and currency exclusivity and exclusivity contradict
  - With the increase of gold production, the compound standard gradually to the gold standard transition
+ *Gold standard system*
  - Gold coin standard.
  - Gold bullion standard (raw gold standard)
  - Gold exchange standard (virtual gold standard)


==== Credit Money System

Credit money system, refers to the monetary system with the paper money and bank notes that are not exchanged for gold as the local currency.

==== International Monetary System

= Frontiers of Virtual Money and Digital Money

== From physical money to virtual currencies: change in the physical sense

=== Evolution of physical and credit money

Economic and social development: A shift in the physical form of the medium of exchange
+ *Physical money*: salt, livestock, sea shells
+ *Metal money*: gold, silver, copper
+ *Credit money*: banknotes, checks, notes
+ *Virtual currency*: Alipay, WeChat wallet, digital currency

=== The emergence of virtual and digital currencies

/ Virtual currencies: The representation of value that does not exist physically and performs monetary functions in certain areas. Such as various tokens, electronic means of payment, etc.
/ Digital currencies: Digital value representation with certain monetary properties. Such as bitcoin, central bank digital currency, etc.
There is some crossover and overlap between the two concepts, but they are not exactly equivalent. While virtual currencies are a broader concept, digital currencies have a more specific point.

== Classifications of virtual money from different perspectives

=== From the perspective of the exchange with physical money

/ Type 1: Two-way isolation, non-exchangeable. Such as the game "tokens”.
- This type of virtual money is mainly used in closed virtual communities or games.
/ Type 2: One-way exchangeable. Rechargeable class tokens, such as Q coins.
- This type of virtual money is essentially an advance payment for a good or service and can be considered a purchase of a product or service that will be needed in the future.
/ Type 3: Two-way exchangeable.
- For specific populations: Such virtual money can be considered as purchases of products or services that are transferable and whose impact on the real world is not fundamentally different from the sale of products and services in general.
- For the general population: Again, there are two types of price volatility. High volatility such as Bitcoin, which is essentially an investment asset. Low volatility such as PayPal balance, which is close to a currency in its actual function.

=== From the perspective of asset and liability properties

Physical money is an asset to the holder but not a liability to anyone. Credit money is an asset of the holder and a liability of the issuer.

/ Virtual Currency:
+ Issued by game companies or social platforms, and its use is limited only to game players and participants of social platforms.
  - Gaming companies and social platforms are effectively selling such virtual currencies as commodities. While such virtual currencies are assets of the holder, they are not liabilities of the seller.
+ The electronification	of	the liabilities	of traditional financial institutions.
  - A shift in the form of money. In terms of properties, this type of virtual currency is still a liability of the issuer and an asset of the holder. The virtual currency represented by the Alipay account balance is also an asset of the holder and a liability of the issuer.
+ The digital currency represented by Bitcoin.
  - An asset to the holder and not a liability to anyone. Other digital currencies, similar to Bitcoin, have this property. This property is very similar to that of metallic currencies. In addition, bitcoins are issued in the same limited quantities as metal currencies.
  
=== From the perspective of issuer

+ The issuers involve gaming platforms and online social networking platforms.
  - The issuance of this type of virtual currency generally does not involve financial institutions.
+ Book-entry currencies associated with bank accounts, such as those based on various types of bank card (including credit cards) payment.
  - This type of currency is sometimes referred to as electronic money.
+ Has no issuer.
  - It is mainly represented by Bitcoin, Litecoin, etc.

== Private digital currencies

=== The underlying technology of private digital currencies

/ Bitcoin: An electronic cash system based on peer-to-peer payments, which invented blockchain technology based on digital signatures by introducing timestamp servers and proof-of-work mechanisms.
/ Blockchain: A distributed bookkeeping technology in which all bookkeeping nodes keep the complete ledger.

+ Hash function
+ Transaction orders
+ Block
+ Blockchain
+ Proof-of-Workload

=== Characteristics of private digital currencies

+ Decentralization
+ Anonymity
+ Traceability
+ Non-Liability

=== The challenges private digital currencies face in the future

Can Bitcoin replace legal tender? Challenges:
+ Differences in the order of magnitude
+ The contradiction between decentralization and centralization
+ Unstable value, difficult to use as a denomination currency.

== Central Bank Digital Currency

=== Concept of legal digital currencies

The digital form of legal tender issued by the central bank.
- Liabilities of the central bank, assets of the holder.
- The	Bank	of	England’s	definition	of	legal	digital	currencies	is	central	bank digital currencies, or CBDC for short, which is the electronic form of central by	households	and	businesses	to	make bank	money	that	can	be	used payments and store value.
- Digital Chinese Yuan, e-CNY.

=== Design of the digital RMB system

+ Digital RMB is a legal tender issued by the central bank and has legal tender status, a digital form of RMB paper banknotes.
+ The digital RMB adopts a centralized management and two-tier operation system. The right to issue digital RMB is vested in the People's Bank of China, and the operating system is centered on the People's Bank of China, with authorized commercial banks issuing digital RMB to the public.
+ The digital RMB is mainly positioned as a cash-based payment voucher (M0) and will co-exist with RMB paper currency in the long term.
+ The digital RMB is a retail-type central bank digital currency that is primarily used to meet domestic retail payment needs.

=== Advantages of digital RMB

+ Reduces the operation and maintenance costs of paper banknotes.
+ Changes the payment method.
+ Facilitates monitoring the efficiency of currency operations.
