== Operation of commercial banks

/ Operating objectives: Profit maximization
/ Operating principles: Safety, liquidity, profitability

=== The principle of safety
  
- Safety refers to the degree of reliability of a commercial bank's assets against loss in the course of its operations.
-  Measures of safety:
  + Loan to deposit ratio
  + Assets to capital ratio
  + Ratio of liabilities to liquid assets
  + Ratio of problem loans to all loans

- Liquidity refers to the ability of a commercial bank to meet customer withdrawals at any time.
- It is divided into *asset liquidity* and *liability liquidity*.
- Measures of liquidity:
  + Cash to asset ratio
  + Loan to deposit ratio
  + Ratio of liquid assets to all liabilities or all loans

=== The principle of profitability

- Profitability refers to the profitability of a commercial bank under normal operating conditions.
- Measures of	profitability:

  + Return on equity = net income / total capital

== Risk management of Internet micro-credit companies

=== Credit risk (main)

- Internet micro-credit companies exhibit a *higher risk of credit default* because of their networked business model and nationwide scope of operations and increased information asymmetry.
- The issuing group of Internet microloans is mainly SMEs, most of whom have little credit awareness and do not pay enough attention to creditworthiness in the Internet environment.
- Engaged in a highly competitive industry with weak risk prevention ability.
- Since the current laws concerning Internet micro-credit companies are not perfect and the social credit system has not yet been uniformly established, the current laws do not effectively protect the right of recovery of Internet micro-credit companies if there is a default by the client.

=== Internal control
